# Developer Guide

## 1. Introduction
Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently. 
This developer guide provides information on the architecture and design of the application. It will not only help you get started as a Cent Wise Dollar Wise contributer, but that you will find useful to refer to even if you are already a contributer of this project. 

## 2. Setting up
### 2.1 Prerequisites
- JDK 1.8.0_60 or later <br>
üõà Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
üõà This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
- IntelliJ IDE <br>
üõà IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. <br>
üõà Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

### 2.2 Setting up the project in your computer
The following are the steps to set up the project in your computer:
1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ. If you are not in the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the existing project dialog first.
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
4. Click Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure.
5. Click New‚Ä¶‚Äã and find the directory of the JDK.
6. Click Import Project.
7. Locate the build.gradle file and select it. Click OK
8. Click Open as Project
9. Click OK to accept the default settings
10. Open a console and run the command gradlew processResources (Mac/Linux: ./gradlew processResources). It should finish with the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message. This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

### 2.3 Verifying the setup
The following are the steps to verify your setup:
1. Run the seedu.duke.Duke and try a few commands.

## 3. Design & implementation
### 3.1 Architecture
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735431-4886f780-1b15-11eb-920c-24e5bf7a76fe.png) <br>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

Main: Initializes spending list at app launch and coordinates the interaction between other components

DukeException: Issues exceptions if there are errors in storage or wrong format of user input is detected

SpendingList: Stores the expenditure of the user as individual entries

Storage: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

Ui: Interacts with the user

Command: Executes the user command or system-issued command

Parser: Analyzes the user command

**How the architecture components interact with each other** <br>

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues a general command. <br>

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `add -c food -d beer -s USD 10` to add chicken rice into the spending list
2. The `add` command calls `AddCommand#execute`
3. `AddCommand#execute` calls the following operations in order:
   1. AddCommand#updateAmount to convert the amount ‚Äú10‚Äù to SGD
   2. AddCommand#updateCurrency to update the currency from ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù to ‚ÄúSGD‚Äù
   3. SpendingList#addItem to add beer into the spending list
   4. Ui#printAdd to print a message if beer is successfully added into the spending list
   5. SpendingListCategoriser#execute to categorise beer under the food category of the spending list
   6. WarnCommand#execute to print a warning message if required
